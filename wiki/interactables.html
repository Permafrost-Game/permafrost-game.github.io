							The in-game <a href="">NPCs</a>
						</div>
						<p>A non-player character (NPC) is any character in a game which is not controlled by a player.</p>
						<p>The term originated in traditional tabletop role-playing games, where it applies to characters controlled by the gamemaster or referee, rather than another player. In video games, this usually means a character controlled by the computer via algorithmic, predetermined or responsive behaviour, but not necessarily true artificial intelligence.</p>

							<p>The Robot Titan is the main defensive unit of the AI turrets. Their size makes them extremely hard to take down. They usually take time to charge an attack, however their electrical attack should not be underestimated as it can do <strong>random</strong> damage which could be lethal!</p>

							<p>Attack Power: <strong>12-30</strong></p>

							<p>Rogue robots are smaller and more mobile units of the AI offensive army. They tend to randomly invade player's turrets and usually attack in groups.

              is very delicate as the core could cause a random explosion that might result in colonist's death!</strong></p>
